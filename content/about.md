Hi, I am Abby Willard, and I am cuurently attending the University of Arkansas, graduating class of 2024. I am currently enrolled in the Data Science Major and am excited to see what the new program does for me, my peers, and the university as a whole. I grew up in San Antonio, Texas, and am a big Spurs fan.
